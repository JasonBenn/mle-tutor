# 3 - Probability
One of the most common applications of “counting things” is to count the possible number of states from which a choice is randomly made. This brings us to the study of probability, which we will explore in a little more depth.
Suggested prework: LL chapter 7 Further study:
MCS chapters 17-21
Rosen chapter 7

# 7 - Linear algebra crash course
In a single class we will attempt to get to the root of a vast field of study: linear algebra, the basis (ha) of computer graphics, machine learning among other applications in computer science.
Suggested prework: watch Essence of linear algebra videos 1-7 Further study:
Blog post: An Intuitive Guide to Linear Algebra
Interactive online book immersive linear algebra
Gilbert Strang’s excellent but non-interactive book Introduction to Linear Algebra Gilbert Strang’s excellent MIT lecture series


# 8 - Cryptography
In this class we dip our toes into number theory, to explore one of its most famous applications: public key cryptography.
Suggested prework: LL chapters 15 and 16 Further study:
MCS chapter 9
6.042J videos: number theory 1 and 2
